## Individual contributors
You can download, install, and use Opencast without telling anyone, no problem. However, by telling peopole you did, by describing your setup on list, or telling people about the challenges you faced, your are already contributing to the community. Because others can benefit from your experience. 

The opportunities to support the community grow with your experience: File bugs, help people on list, prepare the next release by testing the latest version. Or take care of the wiki, the website, and inform your respective community about Opencast. It's almost impossible not to contribute.

## Institutional contributors
Institutions using Opencast usually decide what their empoloyees can do with respect to the software; by allowing them to become active members, you are giving back to the community. By joining our meetings and sharing your plans,
you are building the Opencast networks the software relies upon.

## Institutional supporters
The more your institutions benefits from Opencast, the more you should be involved in the product development and the community, host an event or a server the community benefits from.

Once you are successfully providing services with Opencast, think about supporting us by joining the [Apereo foundation](http://apereo.org/):
