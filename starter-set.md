To celebrate Opencast 10th anniversary the Opencast community is giving away 5 Opencast starter-sets!

We hope that these starter sets will enable professors, smaller institutes or student initiatives to get an easy start with Opencast and showcase usecases for lecture recording to their institutions. 

A set consist of:

* An Opencast system for 1 year on a commercial webhoster. It is up to the winner to take over the contract after that time or move the installation to their own data centers. The server will have 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM and 480GB Storage. This should be enough for around 150 hours of recordings within this year. 
* A hardware capture agent. This will be [NCast](https://www.ncast.com/) Presentation Recorder 720 or 1080. The capture agents have been donated by Universities that have updated to more recent hardware. They are tested and completly functioning, but they come without any warranty. NCast is still providing free firmware upgrades for these devices. The winners can keep the recorders, even if they stop using Opencast after the trial year.
