# [Try it!](https://develop.opencast.org/){:target="_blank"}

There is a demo instance of the Opencast system available. If you want to get an impression on how Opencast is working try this system. You can try whatever you want, as the system gets cleaned up every 24 hours. The credentials for an admin user are automatically set. 
There are a few demo videos included by default that can be seen by everybody in the Media Module.

The Opencast software runs on Linux or MacOS servers. There are repositories with binaries available for CentOS (RPM) and Debian (DEB) like distributions. There are also Docker images available. If none of this works for you, you also find a detailed guide on how to build Opencast yourself.
