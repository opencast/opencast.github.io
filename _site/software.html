<h1 id="getting-started-with-opencast">Getting Started with Opencast</h1>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions regarding Opencast. This will help you determine if it’s the right solution for your organization.</p>

<div class="boxgroup" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1; border-color: #000000; ">
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>Opencast is a free, open source software. There is no direct cost associated with downloading and deploying the software. As an open source software, there is free support from the community on the Opencast mailing lists and the Opencast IRC channel. If you require enterprise-level support, there are commercial vendors that provide that service. Keep in mind, for production use you will need several servers and staff to maintain your system.</p>

</div>

<div class="boxgroup" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1; border-color: #000000; ">
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-setup-an-opencast-system">How long does it take to setup an Opencast system?</h2>

<p>Setting up a basic Opencast server can be done in a few hours. But Opencast is typically a building block within a larger video capture ecosystem and it is highly customizable. Generally it’s best to plan for a 1-3 month deployment depending on the complexity of your project. For Universities, there is often a small pilot rolled-out and tested before a campus-wide solution is developed.</p>

</div>

<div class="boxgroup" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1; border-color: #000000; ">
<h2 id="how-well-will-it-integrate-with-what-we-already-have">How well will it integrate with what we already have?</h2>

<p>Opencast was developed as an open source solution so that it could work well in any environment. The Opencast Marketplace is full of technology providers with active integrations, but the open API lets you develop any integration that’s needed. Opencast adheres to; iCalendar, RSS, ATOM, OAI-PMH, MPEG-7, Dublin Core, LTI, REST standards.</p>

</div>

<div class="boxgroup" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1; border-color: #000000; ">
<h2 id="how-does-opencast-compare-to-proprietary-solutions">How does Opencast compare to proprietary solutions?</h2>

<p>The feedback from the community is primarily around the flexibility and scalability of the Opencast platform. It has all the common features built-in with the ability to add any features you require without the development cycles of proprietary solution providers.</p>

<h2 id="will-students-and-professors-like-it">Will students and professors like it?</h2>

<p>Educators love Opencast because once it’s set up, they don’t have to worry about much. Lectures are automatically queued to record, so there is little day-to-day management. Students benefit from the easy access to videos on CMS, iTunes, YouTube or RSS subscriptions. Advanced search features also help end-users find the content they are looking for quickly and easily.</p>

</div>

<div class="boxgroup" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1; border-color: #000000; ">
<h2 id="why-is-open-source-the-best-option">Why is open source the best option?</h2>

<p>Open source is a great way to highlight your organization’s drive for innovation by contributing back to the community. Because Opencast is a community-based solution, you have the benefit of learning directly from and collaborating with like-minded organizations. Open source solutions also have a longer ‘shelf-life’ because the active community is continuing to develop and you don’t have to worry about a software provider discontinuing elements of their software or hardware – which can become extremely costly to replace. You can also continue to change and develop software to address your needs, so it allows for much more flexibility, and more seamless integration with your other IT-systems.</p>

<h2 id="how-often-are-new-features-rolled-out-by-the-community">How often are new features rolled out by the community?</h2>

<p>Every year there are two major releases to Opencast. Throughout the year, maintenance releases, bug fixes and new features are deployed on an on-going basis.</p>

<h1 id="3-reasons-university-of-manchester-chose-opencast">3 Reasons University of Manchester Chose Opencast</h1>
<p>The University of Manchester with the worlds largest lecture recording installation did not have a preference when it came to the use of open-source or commercial system for lecture capture. After thorough research, they found Opencast to be the best solution for the following reasons:</p>

<div class="fullsizebox" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #eff0f1">
  <div class="fullsizebox-content">

      
      <img class="fullsizebox-image" src="/assets/img/cost-2.jpg" alt="1. Cost logo" style="float:left; width: 50%;" />

     
    <div class="fullsizebox-text">
      <h3> 1. Cost </h3>
      <p>
        <p>Opencast proved to be incredibly cost effective, with no licensing or support fees. It is easy to test without financial commitment and long term, the operating costs are very low.</p>

      </p>

<div class="fullsizebox" style="color: #606c71; background-color: #ffffff">

    <div class="fullsizebox-text">
      <h3> 2. Scalability </h3>
      <p>
        <p>The modular system design of Opencast meant that Manchester could pick and choose which elements to leverage for their deployment. This also meant that they could run many instances of high demand services in parallel, such as workers and ingest nodes.</p>

      </p>

      <img class="fullsizebox-image" src="/assets/img/custom-2.jpg" alt="3. Customization logo" style="float:left; width: 50%;" />

     
    <div class="fullsizebox-text">
      <h3> 3. Customization </h3>
      <p>
        <p>Manchester had a compressed timeline for the project which required new functionality to be delivered very quickly. This also made it a requirement that the solution was flexible and adaptive to the changing needs of the University. Because Opencast is open source it allowed Manchester to deliver change swiftly, with direct access to the code base we were free to develop new extensions, functions and fixes with the minimum of time.</p>
